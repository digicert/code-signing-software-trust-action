inputs:
  digicert-cdn:
    description: |
      DigiCert CDN or STM environment to download the required STM tools.
      Default https://pki-downloads.digicert.com/stm/latest
    default: 'https://pki-downloads.digicert.com/stm/latest'
    required: false

    description: 'File or Directory(files) to sign'
    required: false
  diegest-alg:
    description: 'Digest(Hash) algorithm'
    default: 'SHA-256'
    required: false
  fail-fast:
    description: | 
      Continue signing all the files even if there are errors in some.
      Applies only if input is a directory with mulitple supported files.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  zero-exit-code-on-failure:
    description: |
      Return 0 exit code from the process even if there are errors (Not recommended).
    default: 'false'
  unsigned:
    description: Sign only unsigned files.
    default: 'false'
    required: false
  timestamp:
    description: 'Timestamping'
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  use-binary-sha256-checksum:
    description: |
      Use the SHA-256 checksum file provided on the CDN to handle caching.
      This ensures that new versions are automatically downloaded when they are available.
      If this option is not enabled, the system instead relies on cache-version
      to determine whether a new download is needed.
      This workflow functions when cache-version is updated and 'use-github-caching-service' is enabled.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  cache-version:
    description: |
      Makes use of Github tool cache feature, useful only with self-hosted runners.
      Change this to make Github runner download the next latest version of the tool.
      This is not the actual version of the tool but is only used for caching to avoid redundant downloads.
      The default value uses a semantic version format with a '-0' suffix (e.g., '0.0.0-0') to ensure
      compatibility with caching mechanisms that expect semantic versioning.
      This value is arbitrary and does not reflect the tool's actual version.
    default: '0.0.0-0'
    required: false
  simple-signing-mode: 
    description: |
      Setup Software Trust Manager for simplified signing. Only installs smctl.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
  use-github-caching-service:
    description: |
      Default tool caching doesn't work on Github runners. So use this to enable
      Github provided caching service to cache Software Trust Manager tools across runs.
    required: false
    default: 'true'
  bulk-sign-mode:
    description: |
      Sign multiple files in a single operation. This action only works when you are simple signing.
    required: false
    default: 'false'
