# Code signing with DigiCert® Software Trust Manager

Code signing with DigiCert® Software Trust Manager and GitHub Actions is a streamlined, keypair-based signing workflow that improves software security and seamlessly integrates with DevOps processes to sign binaries on **Windows**, **Linux**, and **Mac**.

GitHub Actions automates the installation and configuration of Software Trust client tools, enabling developers to quickly become signing-ready for workflows on [GitHub-hosted runners][github-hosted-runners-ref] and [self-hosted runners][self-hosted-runners-ref].

Additionally, Software Trust with GitHub Actions offers simple signing, which allows users to sign without the need of third-party tools or libraries.

## Introduction to Software Trust

Software Trust provides a solution to manage and automate your code signing workflows in a secure way. 

**Software Trust will:**

- Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for signing
- Prevent unauthorized access or misuse of keys and certificates
- Enforce consistency and compliance of security policies
- Protect against malware insertion during software releases
- Expedite remediation by providing an audit history of all actions taken within your account

**Software Trust allows you to securely:**

- Generate and manage your credentials
- Create, edit, import, export, or delete keypairs
- Generate certificates using a keypair in your account
- View your audit and signature logs
- Create releases
- Sign code

## Get started

### Step 1: Obtain a DigiCert ONE account

Software Trust is part of the DigiCert® ONE platform, which also includes DigiCert® Trust Lifecycle Manager, DigiCert® Document Trust Manager, and DigiCert® IoT Trust Manager, enabling organizations to manage their diverse PKI workflows from a single pane of glass.

To access Software Trust, you must have a DigiCert ONE account. If you don't have a DigiCert ONE account, you can request a 30-day free trial account from [DigiCert Sales][digicert-sales-ref].

### Step 2: Update YAML file

Copy and paste one of the following steps into your GitHub Actions workflow YAML file to obtain the latest stable version of Software Trust:

**Software Trust with standard features:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE from base64 secret data
    run: |
      export SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE=${RUNNER_TEMP_DIR}/sm_client_cert.p12
      echo "${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE_B64 }}" | base64 --decode > ${SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE}
      shell: bash
  - name: Setup Software Trust Manager
    uses: digicert/code-signing-software-trust-action@v1
    env:
      SM_HOST: ${{ vars.SM_HOST }}
      SM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SM_API_KEY }}
      SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE: ${SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE}
      SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD }}
```

**Software Trust with simplified signing:**

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE from base64 secret data
    run: |
      export SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE=${RUNNER_TEMP_DIR}/sm_client_cert.p12
      echo "${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE_B64 }}" | base64 --decode > ${SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE}
      shell: bash
  - name: Setup Software Trust Manager
    uses: digicert/code-signing-software-trust-action@v1
    with:
      simple-signing-mode: true
      # If the below 2 parameters are supplied, then smctl executable is invoked to attempt the signing.
      input: <file or directory with list of supported files to sign>
      keypair-alias: <a Software Trust Manager keypair to sign with>
    env:
      SM_HOST: ${{ vars.SM_HOST }}
      SM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SM_API_KEY }}
      SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE: ${SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE}
      SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD }}
```

To learn more about these steps, see [action.yml](action.yml).

### Step 3: Customize setup (inputs)

Review the following variables that you can use to customize your setup:

| Name                         | Type     | Default                        | Description|
|-                             |-         |-                               |-|
| `digicert-cdn`               | Optional |<https://pki-downloads.digicert.com/stm/latest>   |The URL for the DigiCert® CDN used to download the required Software Trust tools.|
| `keypair-alias`              | Optional | Not applicable                               |A keypair alias.|
| `input`                      | Optional | Not applicable                                 |A file or directory contained supported files to sign.|
| `digest-alg`                | Optional | SHA-256                        |Digest (hash) algorithm.|
| `fail-fast`                  | Optional | True                           |Allows signing of all supported files in a directory, even if some files encounter an error. Only applies if the input is a directory with multiple supported files.|
| `zero-exit-code-on-failure`  | Optional | False                          |Returns an exit code of **0** even if errors occur during execution. (Not recommended.)|
| `unsigned`                   | Optional | False                          |Signs only unsigned files.|
| `timestamp`                  | Optional | True                           |Enables or disables timestamping on signed files.|
| `cache-version`              | Optional | 0.0.0-0                        |Overrides the default [Github tool cache][tool-cache-ref] key to prompt GitHub runners to download the next available version.<br/>This value is used only for caching purposes and does not affect the actual tool version.|
| `simple-signing-mode`        | Optional | False                          |Installs only **smctl** to enable simplified signing.|
| `use-github-caching-service` | Optional | True                           |Enables GitHub’s built-in caching service. This stores Software Trust tools across workflow runs since default tool caching is not supported on GitHub runners.|
| `use-binary-sha256-checksum` | Optional | True                           |Uses SHA256 checksum from CDN for automatic version detection and caching. When enabled, tools are automatically updated when new versions are released (Recommended).|
| `bulk-sign-mode`             | Optional | False                          |Signs multiple files in a single operation. Only works with `simple-signing-mode`.|

### Step 4: Review required environment variables

|Environment variable                      | Description| Recommendation|
|-                         |-           |-              |
|SM_HOST                   |The specific environment URL used to connect to Software Trust.|[Use GitHub Actions variables][github-vars-ref]|
|SM_API_KEY                |An API key generated from your DigiCert® ONE account to use with a service user account.|[Use GitHub Actions secrets][github-secrets-ref]|
|SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE       |A .p12-format client certificate file generated for the service user from DigiCert® ONE Account Manager.|[Use GitHub Actions secrets][github-secrets-ref]|
|SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD   |The password for the encrypted .p12 client certificate file. |[Use GitHub Actions secrets][github-secrets-ref]|

> **Note**: Since the client certificate is downloaded as a .p12 file from the DigiCert® ONE Account Manager, we recommend that you store the file content as a Base64-encoded string in a secret. When you execute, you can decode it into a file using the `base64` command (or an equivalent tool).
>
> Review the following example to generate the certificate file from the Base64 secret:
>
> ```yaml
>   steps:
>  - name: Setup SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE from base64 secret data
>    run: |
>      export SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE=${RUNNER_TEMP_DIR}/sm_client_cert.p12
>      echo "${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE_B64 }}" | base64 --decode > ${SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE}
>      shell: bash
> ```
>
> The `base64` command is available by default on **Linux** and **macOS**. For **Windows** runners, verify that the command is supported.

## Outputs

The following outputs are provided by this action:

| Name             | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `PKCS11_CONFIG`  | The absolute path to the PKCS#11 configuration file (`pkc11Properties.cfg`). This file is automatically generated when Software Trust tools are installed and contains the library path to the PKCS#11 module. Use this output in subsequent steps that require PKCS#11 configuration for signing operations with third-party tools. |

**Example usage:**

```yaml
- name: Setup Software Trust Manager
  id: stm-setup
  uses: digicert/code-signing-software-trust-action@v1
  env:
    SM_HOST: ${{ vars.SM_HOST }}
    SM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SM_API_KEY }}
    SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE: ${{ env.SM_CLIENT_CERT_FILE }}
    SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.SM_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD }}

- name: Use PKCS11 config in subsequent step
  run: |
    echo "PKCS11 config file location: ${{ steps.stm-setup.outputs.PKCS11_CONFIG }}"
    # Use the config file with your signing tool
```
